Binary Classification with Linear Models

This repository contains the implementation and analysis for Lab 1, which explores the fundamentals of binary classification using linear models and tensor-based computation.

Overview

Selected a real-world binary classification dataset (Adult Income – UCI)

Performed feature selection and feature engineering

Generated random parameter sets for linear models

Defined a suitable loss function (binary cross-entropy)

Evaluated model performance using train/test splits

Identified best-performing models based on loss
